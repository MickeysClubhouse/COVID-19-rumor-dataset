https://mobile.twitter.com/DailyMail/status/1221937442451836928,Mon Jan 27 2020,@jonwvalentine @DailyMail @MailOnline There arent patents for this virus that's misinformation. There are patents for something completely different used as part of pandemic research. This is an animal-originated virus (which are the most dangerous pathogens). Remember how deadly avian flu was? 60% mortality rate.,Tue Jan 28 00:36:05 +0000 2020,0,0,0,10:13.9,deny

There are patents for the virus and someone has been monkeying around with it for who knows why.,Mon Jan 27 23:41:20 +0000 2020,0,5,5,10:13.9,comment
