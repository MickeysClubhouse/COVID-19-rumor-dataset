994743178035812854,Wed Jan 22 2020,@PHE_uk I thought the whole city of Wuhan was meant to be in quarantine so how are they even allowed to fly. As usual half assed measures from our public health,Thu Jan 23 14:33:54 +0000 2020,0,13,13,05:59.0,comment

994743178035812854,Wed Jan 22 2020,@PHE_uk Real talk! Honestly there should be no flights going anywhere. We know that during the incubation of the virus there may not be symptoms in the early days. Why risk. Contain the area and the virus. This will get out of hand if planes are not grounded immediately.,Fri Jan 24 20:32:27 +0000 2020,2,23,23,05:59.0,support
