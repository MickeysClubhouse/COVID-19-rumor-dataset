4894391149051026319,Fri Jan 17 2020,"@davorasmussen @CVRinfo @IBAHCM @virological_org Difficult to say without a more complete analysis. These models used both phylogenetic clustering and genome-wide compositional biases, but those using only genomic biases (also not entirely independent from phylogeny) gave the same overall result.",Fri Jan 17 12:52:46 +0000 2020,0,3,3,46:46.9,comment
4894391149051026319,Fri Jan 17 2020,"@DanielStreicker @CVRinfo @IBAHCM @virological_org Very cool! Just curious @DanielStreicker, is this largely based on phylogenetic placement of this virus or is there something else especially ""batty"" about this particular virus?",Fri Jan 17 12:48:33 +0000 2020,0,2,2,46:46.9,support

4894391149051026319,Fri Jan 17 2020,"@arambaut @CVRinfo @IBAHCM @virological_org Based on our analyses of MERS and Ebola from the original paper, its evident that host-associated genomic biases evolve very slowly and are partly, but not entirely, linked to virus phylogeny",Fri Jan 17 12:59:58 +0000 2020,0,1,1,46:46.9,comment
4894391149051026319,Fri Jan 17 2020,@DanielStreicker @CVRinfo @IBAHCM @virological_org To what degree is this result due to genetic proximity to bat viruses? Have you done this on MERS (which looks now like it has been in camels for years before jumping into humans)?,Fri Jan 17 12:53:46 +0000 2020,0,0,0,46:46.9,query
