836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,@drachenvogel @brianschatz Its been illegal for the CDC to study gun violence since 1996. Donald Trump flouted CDC recommendations on confirmed Coronavirus patients returning to the US.,Mon Feb 24 03:21:49 +0000 2020,1,2,2,51:50.8,comment

836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,"@CAP_PhD @brianschatz There is a pandemic in progress.  No announcement.  I am sure they will soon, but recent flights to the US have needlessly exposed thousands of people.CDC is partly political, such as wasting money non-medical stuff like gun violence.Anyway, Trump is irrelevant in this mess.",Mon Feb 24 03:13:41 +0000 2020,0,0,0,51:50.8,comment

836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,"@drachenvogel @brianschatz The CDC does vaccine research that does indeed help generate new vaccines. They also survey worldwide infection trends to make recommendations for vaccine production. Your judgment as to their being ""behind the curve"" is based on what, exactly?",Mon Feb 24 02:11:13 +0000 2020,1,5,5,51:50.8,comment
836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,@CAP_PhD @brianschatz Very convincing.  Go to their web site.  Presumably they are breaking the law then.https://t.co/fUE5PzSxJfThis stuff isn't free.  Maybe they don't pay for the studies per se but they waste money reporting on it.,Mon Feb 24 03:26:12 +0000 2020,0,0,0,51:50.8,comment
836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,"@brianschatz Always Trump.So if the CDC had more dollars, we wouldn't have pandemic in China, Korea, Iran, Italy...?The CDC doesn't even make the vaccines.

836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,"@CAP_PhD @brianschatz In any case, the Dickey Amendment, which you are presumably referencing, only stops them from advocating a position, not from researching it.Total waste of money unless you can figure out which microbe makes people willing to take another's life.",Mon Feb 24 03:28:57 +0000 2020,0,0,0,51:50.8,comment
836597791766750251,Mon Feb 24 2020,"@drachenvogel @brianschatz Well, CDC's under Health and Human Services, and gun violence is within their purview. If you want to study gun violence as an epidemic, CDC has the epidemiologists. As for political overreach, how was the Dickey Amendment not a political tool in itself?",Mon Feb 24 04:13:02 +0000 2020,0,0,0,51:50.8,comment
