https://mobile.twitter.com/coriiiiiiiiiii1/status/1225143326246129664,Wed Feb 05 2020,@coriiiiiiiiiii1 Here are 2 things to look up. Cysticercosis and ONSET GERIATRIC SEIZURES-ASIA. These explain the 2 videos without involving the coronavirus as a source. This is not how this virus works. The ONLY reports of seizures are on twitter and using the same 4 videos. It's misinformation.,Thu Feb 06 14:50:34 +0000 2020,2,1,1,15:00.6,comment

https://mobile.twitter.com/coriiiiiiiiiii1/status/1225143326246129664,Wed Feb 05 2020,@MyMymechanic How can you be sure of that 100%? Only through a test that detects the blood can confirm and that is not even 100% accurate 100% of the time. I think if the virus attacks nerve cells or the brain it could possibly cause seizures and/or muscle convulsions.,Wed Feb 05 20:20:01 +0000 2020,0,4,4,15:00.6,query
https://mobile.twitter.com/coriiiiiiiiiii1/status/1225143326246129664,Wed Feb 05 2020,@TardPoke Thank you for this information. The CDC has listed convulsions as a symptom of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The leading numbers are also misinformation - without full disclosure to the public we can only speculate.
