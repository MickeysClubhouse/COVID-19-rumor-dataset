https://mobile.twitter.com/UnbreakableHate/status/1234161323392610306,Sun Mar 01 2020,@UnbreakableHate @CDCgov @US_FDA @Surgeon_General I could definitely see people not wanting to go to the doctors if they thought they had the coronavirus.Who the fuck would wanted to be quarantined with an alternate version of the flu. People have lives and animals.Pets can't take care of themselves.,Mon Mar 02 06:28:30 +0000 2020,0,3,3,37:23.8,comment

But we should also ask how many vapers are catching COVID-19. I suspect the number is very low. PG vapor is a powerful protection against airborne contagions, including the flu. It's possible that @VapingSavesLives in more ways than we thought.",Mon Mar 02 05:30:04 +0000 2020,2,3,3,37:23.8,support

They have misinformed everybody about vaping, I wouldn't trust them to contain the flu-like virus.I wouldn't doubt if somebody was coughing they would lock them up in quarantine while their pets die at home, such a sad country we live in.",Mon Mar 02 06:25:52 +0000 2020,0,3,3,37:23.8,deny
