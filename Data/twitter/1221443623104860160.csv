4358816563023776121,Sun Jan 26 2020,There is no transparency or reassurance from the government of things happening in the city. Rumors such as overcrowded hospitals are making people nervous. What worries us the most right now is whether we can even get diagnosis and treatment in the hospital if we get infected.,Sun Jan 26 14:43:46 +0000 2020,414,1343,1343,58:14.5,comment

4358816563023776121,Sun Jan 26 2020,"But as time pass, I am slowly realizing what the locals worry is not so much of the #coronavirus, but rather the incompetency the CCP government is handling the outbreak. Since the lockdown, everyone is trapped at home and have no idea what is really happening in the city.",Sun Jan 26 14:43:46 +0000 2020,609,1655,1655,58:14.5,comment
