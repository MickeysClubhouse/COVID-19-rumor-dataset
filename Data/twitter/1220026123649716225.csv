1791395751131146610,Wed Jan 22 2020,"@PreventionAC @NPR Hey there! The language the CDC uses is actually ""effectively no risk"" so the language we used in the piece aims to reflect that.",Wed Jan 22 21:42:14 +0000 2020,0,2,2,49:04.6,comment
1791395751131146610,Wed Jan 22 2020,@PaigePfleger @NPR Extremely poor wording re: little risk. CDC says effectively no risk and uses the word effectively because it is not possible to statistically rule out a non-zero risk. All evidence to date suggests that it is not possible. https://t.co/R3PiwHYBow,Wed Jan 22 22:54:51 +0000 2020,0,2,2,49:04.6,comment
