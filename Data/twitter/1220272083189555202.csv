And the replies were mostly like ""fake"", ""believe our CCP Party"", ""No big deal"" or ""it's always under control"". 衤",Thu Jan 23 09:23:36 +0000 2020,1,15,15,08:12.7,comment
7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich Not only that, there are reports of people getting sick who have never been to Wuhan before. I don't know if you heard of this. In either case, keeping it a secret is counterproductive in controlling the spread of the virus ! God knows how many people have spread it unknowingly !",Thu Jan 23 09:14:31 +0000 2020,0,1,1,08:12.7,comment
7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,@jmulich Blaming the inferior instead of the system is part of the crisis protocol in this country.,Thu Jan 23 09:26:14 +0000 2020,0,1,1,08:12.7,comment
7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich @resilienthkgirl Indeed its quite mutual, they are brave Chinese voicing out the seriousness of it in early January, but not being trusted by the public at all and are arrested by the government. The majority of Chinese people only will action when their own interest is affected",Thu Jan 23 11:51:29 +0000 2020,0,1,1,08:12.7,comment

7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich As long as China was in WHO, everything would be still the same. It is a old story in 2003. CCP saveed the money in medical treatments for patients and didn't need to develop vaccines.",Thu Jan 23 17:15:29 +0000 2020,0,0,0,08:12.7,comment
7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich The reasons why #WuhanPneumonia breaks out in such large scale, are not only the system covering up the truth, but also the people who lack of sanitary awareness.

7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich and maybe we should be asking how we would deal with a similar emergency here. Are we prepared? Are resources adequately funded?

7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@ChipFaust @jmulich The ""preparation"" is making sure it doesn't happen at all. i.e. proactive prevention, not reactive containment. The meat industry is highly regulated and sale of livestock in public markets almost unheard of. China's wet markets are a hotbed for new diseases to evolve in.",Fri Jan 24 00:26:41 +0000 2020,0,1,1,08:15.3,comment

That's why it was decided to close the city at 10am to allow political and business people to flee #Wuhan. https://t.co/0GqHgAvXvY,Thu Jan 23 01:12:47 +0000 2020,0,3,3,08:15.3,comment

7850248839713492555,Thu Jan 23 2020,"@jmulich Sure, but also have empathy for other ordinary Chinese people, who are the ones mostly ""blaming"" the Wuhan people. They are also trapped in the same system and feel afraid that Wuhan escapees are bringing a great threat to their own families.
